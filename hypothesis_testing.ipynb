    "## For each of the following questions, formulate a null and alternative hypothesis (be as specific as you can be), then give an example of what a true positive, true negative, type I and type II errors would look like. Note that some of the questions are intentionally phrased in a vague way. It is your job to reword these as more precise questions that could be tested.\n",
